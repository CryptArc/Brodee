# Brodee
In-Game Addon(s) and tweaks for Hearthstone. This is expected to 'fix' things, and allow for changes which are inline with blizzards asthetics. Brodee does not alter any Hearthstone files, although it does inject into the Unity AppDomain. Use at your own discretion. 

## Features

### Done
* Button Menu Options for Brodee

### In progress
* Options menu for brodee
* Gem colour changing(No customization UI)

### Confirmed technically able
* Shortening spell and attack animation(No customization UI)
* Deck creation 'tile' in-game(like deck tracking)(No UI)
* Import Deck from string(No UI)

### Would like to do
In general, aiming for accessibility things first such as colour-blind options and keyboard inputs.
