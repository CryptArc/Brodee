# Brodee
In-Game Addon(s) and tweaks for Hearthstone. This is expected to 'fix' things, and allow for changes which are inline with blizzards asthetics. Brodee does not alter any Hearthstone files, although it does inject into the Unity AppDomain. Use at your own discretion. 

## Features

### Done
* Button Menu Options for Brodee

### Confirmed technically able/In progress(Although no UI for customizing)
* Options menu for brodee
* Gem colour changing
* Shortening spell and attack animation
* Import Deck from string
* Deck creation 'tile' in-game(like deck tracking)

### Would like to do
In general, aiming for accessibility things first such as colour-blind options and keyboard inputs.
