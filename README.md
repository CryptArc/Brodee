# Brodee
In-Game Addon(s) and tweaks for Hearthstone. This is expected to 'fix' things, and allow for changes which are inline with blizzards asthetics. 

## Features

### Done
* Button Menu Options for Brodee

### Confirmed technically able/In progress(Although no UI for customizing)
* Options menu for brodee
* Gem colour changing
* Shortening spell and attack animation
* Import Deck from string
* Deck creation 'tile' in-game(like deck tracking)

### Would like to do
In general, aiming for accessibility things first such as colour-blind options and keyboard inputs.
